- a custom cmd.exe shortcut with the icon of vscode that with one click:
   - starts vcvarsall for the code environment
      - usable with the integrated code ide terminal
   - launches code 
   - has a modifiable staring location

## Modular (copy/paste) folders for various projects

Currently, due to the modularity potential of VS Code and Raylib together, the only application I have setup project folders for is RAYLIB.
