# VS Code Workspace Templates

## Raylib
---
### Raylib templates require raylib to be installed due to the `json & makefile` relationship with `raylib/src/..`

Raylib can be installed on any drive you will just have to change the drive path in the json to reflect drive identifier.

EX: `C:Raylib/src/..` VS  `D:Raylib/src/..`
